### **Is your online discussion overgrown with misinformation? Have a GOAT clear it up.**

[See it on GitHub!](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Wild-Swaying-Goats-Project)

## Product Description

We surveyed college students and found that most never trust what they read online, unless it comes from a friend or a reputable news source. **What would convince them to trust a stranger?**

A **Great Online Anti-misinformation Table**, or a **GOAT**, allows people to quickly present their sources for all to see, **improving trust in online anonymous discussions**.

GOATs streamline the process of sharing sources with a **simple**, **unbiased** user interface. It **incentivizes providing quality sources** and **cleanses discussions of opinions**.

So next time you feel like a discussion may become littered with misinformation, insert a GOAT and **watch it keep your discussion clean**.

Built for the University of Washington Winter 2022 Social Computing Capstone.
