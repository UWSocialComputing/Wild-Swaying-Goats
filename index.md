# GOAT: Greatest Online Anti-misinformation Tables

### **Is your online discussion overgrown with misinformation? Have a GOAT clear it up.**

[See it on GitHub!](https://github.com/UWSocialComputing/Wild-Swaying-Goats-Project)

---

We surveyed college students and found that most never trust what they read online, unless it comes from a friend or a reputable news source. **What would convince them to trust a stranger?**

A **Great Online Anti-misinformation Table**, or a **GOAT**, allows people to quickly present their sources for all to see, **improving trust in online anonymous discussions**.

GOATs streamline the process of sharing sources with a **simple**, **unbiased** user interface. It **incentivizes providing quality sources** and **cleanses discussions of opinions**.

So next time you feel like a discussion may become littered with misinformation, insert a GOAT and **watch it keep your discussion clean**.

Built for the University of Washington Winter 2022 Social Computing Capstone.

#### (From Left to Right)

### Reinard Fegamas

Heyo, I'm a Senior in the CS department graduating March 2022 (this is my last quarter!). I had experience doing web applications, but it was my first time tackling the important issue of misinformation. I learned a lot of design aspects/decisions from the capstone and got to see a lot of cool ideas come to reality with GOAT!

### Max Haak

Hi, I'm a Junior in the CS department graduating in December 2022. I enjoy designing and implementing projects from the ground up and GOAT was a great experience to learn from!

### Jyoti Lama

Hello! I am a Senior in CSE and graduating in June 2022.
This was my first time diving into Social Computing. I had a great time
with my team learning and developing GOAT together.

### Grant Williams
I'm a Senior studying Computer Engineering and graduating in June 2022. I liked seeing how our team turned the word "goat" from a randomly generated team name into the brand for our prototype.
